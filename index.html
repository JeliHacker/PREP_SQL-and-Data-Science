        <h1>SQL and Data Science Prep</h1>
        <h1 class="instructions" style="font-size: 30px;">1. Submit (online) an essay describing how inner join works.</h1>
        
        <h1 class="thirtyPx"><span class="code">INNER JOIN</span> is an SQL keyword that, according to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp">w3schools.com</a>, <q>selects records that have matching values in both tables.</q> <span class="code">JOIN</span> clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables. <span class="code">INNER JOIN</span> only returns records that both rows share.<br><br><img src="innerJoin-venn-diagram.png"></h1>
        
        
        
        <h1 class="instructions">2. Prepare an essay to discuss what a data scientist is. How is it comparable and different from a computer scientist?</h1>
        <p class="thirtyPx" id="giveBorder">The job of a data scientist is to make new discoveries by visualizing data and using algorithms, such as machine learning or regression, to name a few. The job is often compared to that of a computer scientist because they both involve the use of computer technology and algorithms. However, they are different in a few ways.<br>
            <ul class="thirtyPx">
            <li>A data scientist works with a data set to try to answer a question. Computer scientists try to solve problems using programming, software, and algorithms.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Programmers require technical skills to perform. Data scientists require some technical skills along with business knowledge to perform.</li>
                
            <li>While the field of Computer Science is relatively old (some would argue it dates back to the early 1800s), the field of Data Science is new to the scene.</li>
            
        </ul>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3 class="important">Pertinent question: Imagine a Computer Scientist has worked for 30 years and has become quite good at his job. For whatever reason, he wants to take his talents to a similar but new career field before he retires for good. How feasible would it be for a seasoned computer scientist to shift into the field of data science?</h3>
